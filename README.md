Hello! We are a team of developers from ITMO University. At the moment we are developing an application for the Smolny Institute for Noble Maidens. In this app, you can find all the information about the artist Dmitry Grigorievich Levitsky, who is the author of a series of portraits of Smolyan girls who were educated at the Institute.

### Our team:
* [Yana Bubnova](https://github.com/latuapaura) - designer
* [Maria Kobzar](https://github.com/marakobz) - content maker
* [Kartashev Vladimir](https://github.com/ColdDirol) - developer
* [Radaev Nikita](https://github.com/RaddNik2004) - technical writer

We would like to thank Galina Zhirkova, Candidate of Pedagogical Sciences, project leader, for her help in gathering information and to thank the Smolny Institute for its consultation and for providing us with additional information.

###### Waving to anyone interested in our project!
